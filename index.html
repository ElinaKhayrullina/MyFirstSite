    <h1>Choosing a profession</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Elina. I have two university degrees. Economic and pedagogical education (English language).
    So, I have worked as a manager during almost 9 years in the bank, including maternity leave.
    I liked my position, salary before childbirth.</p>
    <p>After maternity leave I tried to work, but to have long hours every working day, it is 
    already impossible when you have family, especially small child.
    And, if be honest, why I decided to change my proffesion -is to get distance work.</p>
    <p>But when I started to learn programmig (I have started to learn Java language), during first
    2 months I wanted to give up, especially when I learned arrays.
    The main advice here - <strong> put yourself together and go ahead, only in such way you will reach
    your goals </strong>.In parallel I have testing training.</p>
    
    <h2>Dilemma</h2>
    <p> So, now I have the main dilemma to start work as a tester or as a programmer.
    Who has the main problem or who wantes to choice the future proffession between these, 
    my article will be usefull.</p>
   
    <p> To be a programmer (pluses): </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Well-paid position</li>
    <li>Amazing feelings when you see, that your code works correctly (when you see result)</li>
        <li>If you have mathematical mindset, it will be great choice for you (you will never be bored)</li>
            <li>If you really fall in love with English, at first it will be easy to work, secondly
    it is great option to improve it.</li>
    <li>Mostly distance position</li>
</ul>

<p> To be a programmer (minuses): </p>
<ol>
    
    <li>To start working as a programmer will take aproximitly 1 year, may be more (if you don't know
    any kind of languages)</li>
    <li>You will need to sit really a lot</li>
        <li>You will need to learn somthing every day during endless time)- but in my case, it is more plus. I like to 
    learn something every day and can't without it.</li>

    he is an alien, at the same moment programmer thiks that users are an ancient people">
    <p> To be a tester (pluses):</p>
</ol>
    <li>To start working as a tester will take aproximitly 3-4 monthes</li>
        <li>Amazing feelings when you see, that your find mistakes (it means, that you help you–∫ colleague to work
    and write correct code).</li>
    <li> You can find distance position</li>
        <li>If you really fall in love with English, at first it will be easy to work, secondly
    it is great option to improve it.</li>
    
    <p> To be a tester (minuses): </p>
    <ol>
        <li>not well-paid position as it has programmer</li>
            <li>You will need to sit a lot</li>
                <li>You will need to learn somthing every day during enless time)- but in my case, it is more plus. I like to 
    learn something every day and can't without it.</li>
</ol>

    <p> So, in my case,I estimated the pros and cons and decided to learn programming deeper, because of salary.
    Of course,<strong> it is long way, but it worth it, especially if you know English, if you like to do it</strong>,</p> 
    <p> I mean to write the code.
    If you don't like, IT-sphere has different kind of positions,like: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/productstar/blog/518426/" target="_blank"> 
    product manager </a>, <a href="https://blog.skillfactory.ru/kto-takoj-project-manager-i-chem-on-zanimaetsya/?ysclid=lale60m1lh364932884" target="_blank"> project-manager</a> and so on.
